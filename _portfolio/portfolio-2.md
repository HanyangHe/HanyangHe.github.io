title: "An interesting thought: How to discover the PWM modulation technology with a first principle thinking way?"
excerpt: >
  Another interesting thought after taking the "Solid State Power Conversion"
  course teaching by Steven Fredette - an interesting guy, a friendly teacher.
  This short article has to some extent solved a long-standing confusion in my heart.
  For those like me who like to ask why and investigate the sources of methods
  and ideas, this article may make you happy.<br/>

Motivation: One of the most common technologies in the field of power electronics. However, usually, the most
basic things need a clever perspective to be discovered. When I first learned about it in the third year of my
undergraduate course, I asked myself several questions: How was it conceived? Why can it achieve its purpose
by doing so? Is there any other or better way to achieve the same goal? Six years later, when I take a power
converter class in UW-M, the lecturer jokingly told us that "Don't ask me how PWM was discovered and why?
Because I don't know. You just need to know how to use it." This rekindled my curiosity. I seized the inspiration
that may be fleeting under the trend of curiosity and immediately recorded my thoughts. Later, this idea was put
into this document. This document gives a perspective on how to find PWM modulation points step by step
originally. Having mastered this fundamental think path, we can find other possible branches more easily in the
process of derivation, so as to achieve innovation. The author did not discuss it more deeply. Perhaps in the next
few years, new inspiration will suddenly emerge.
It is the core of the first principle thinker to have his own understanding and thinking system of knowledge,
instead of blindly worshiping others and completely accepting, and getting rid of the situation of being
completely controlled by others' evaluation.
