Motivation: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is one of the most ubiquitous techniques in power electronics. Yet, its fundamental principles often remain obscured, buried beneath established practices. When I first encountered PWM during my third year of undergraduate study, I asked myself: How was PWM conceived? Why does it work? Are there alternative methods to achieve the same result? Six years later, in a power-converter course at UW-Madison, the lecturer quipped, 'Do not ask me how PWM was discovered or why it works. I also do not know. Just learn to use it.' This spark of curiosity led me to record my own systematic derivation, which has now evolved into this document. By tracing PWM from first principles, we can develop a deeper understanding and more readily explore innovative modulation schemes. Further insights may emerge in the coming years.
