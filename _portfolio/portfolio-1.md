title: "An interesting thought: Discovering Fourier Transform with First Principles Thinking"
excerpt: "This is an interesting thought I had after listening to the signal and system class at UWM. I write a small textbook to give a possible explanation for the essential difference between Z-transform and S-transform, and give an unconventional perspective to discover the Fourier transform originally. As a student, I write this from a student's perspective that I believe students would like to see. After all, users understand their needs the most - haha.(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vX1E28cf1zMBjO86YXrhDYtYRrdgoxks?usp=share_link)<br/><img src='/images/傅里叶目录.png'>"
