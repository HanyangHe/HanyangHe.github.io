title: "An interesting thought: Discovering Fourier Transform with First Principles Thinking"
excerpt: "This is an interesting thought I had after listening to the signal and system class at UWM. I write a small textbook to give a possible explanation for the essential difference between Z-transform and S-transform, and give an unconventional perspective to discover the Fourier transform originally. As a student, I write this from a student's perspective that I believe students would like to see. After all, users understand their needs the most - haha.<br/><img src='/assets/images/FourierTransIndex.PNG'>

Traditional signals and systems textbooks provide detailed and comprehensive explanations of LIT
analysis methods. However, readers may feel not easy to find the conclusion of the Fourier Transform (FT)
naturally and originally. Sometimes, the original way in history to find some useful rules may not be the
easiest. These processes usually include a huge of research experience, inspiration, and even coincidences,
unique to some scientists. Different from traditional books, this one introduces the derivation process of FT
from an opposite angle – starting from general to specific, and then back to general. That means the book
will first introduce why we choose the exponential function as a characteristic function to build the linear
model of the LTI system. Then, how to relate exp-function with Z-Transform (Z-T), and finally to dig out
the FT. After that, the limit of FT will be pointed out and ZT will be reconsidered for more general
applications. Readers may also find there are many other small cycles between general and specific since
this is a way to push on the thinking path. Also, the journey will be pushed on by the cycle of asking and
solving questions, which may also help readers be more proactive and actively involved in the derivation
process. Additionally, an interesting question about the essential difference between ZT and s-Transform
(S-T) will also be discussed.
Why do I want to write this work?
I am interested in a question – to make clear the essential difference between Z-T and s-T. I scoured
the web for this question and asked Prof. Chu about it, but it seems not to be easily explained as I thought
before. The last and most powerful and interesting way to solve this problem is to re-find the derivation
process of those LIT systems’ transform pairs originally. Also, since I am not familiar with this basic and
widely used knowledge area – signal and system analysis, it is valuable for me to review and deepen my
understanding of the modeling ideas. Most importantly, this work may also help others understand this
process easier since it is introducing a new derivation process in a first-principle way.
What is the advantage of this book?
Although this book is not as broad as the knowledge system of traditional textbooks, it has a unified
symbol system for all chapters. In addition, the content of this book is concise, which is more conducive
for readers to browse, contact, and establish an understanding of the whole process. It can be used as
supplementary material to traditional textbooks to provide readers with a new perspective to quickly
understand the essence of LTI system modeling methods and how those transform pairs can be originally
constructed.
