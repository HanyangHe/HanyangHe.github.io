Traditional textbooks on signals and systems offer thorough and systematic explanations of linear time-invariant (LTI) analysis methods. However, readers often find it difficult to naturally and intuitively arrive at the key results for the Fourier Transform (FT) from first principles. The original historical derivation of these mathematical tools was often complex, filled with deep research experience, inspiration, and sometimes even coincidences unique to pioneering scientists. As a result, the path to important conclusions may feel opaque or indirect in many classic texts.
Unlike traditional books, this work approaches the derivation of the Fourier Transform from a novel perspective—moving from the general to the specific and then returning to the general. The journey begins by exploring why the exponential function is chosen as the fundamental solution (or characteristic function) for modeling LTI systems. From there, the relationship between the exponential function and the Z-Transform (ZT) is developed, ultimately leading to a natural emergence of the Fourier Transform. The book also highlights the limitations of the FT, motivating a return to the Z-Transform for more general applications.
Throughout, readers will encounter multiple “cycles” of abstraction and specialization, reflecting the real thinking process involved in mathematical discovery. This iterative process of questioning and problem-solving encourages readers to be more proactive and engaged with the material. Finally, the book discusses a thought-provoking comparison of the essential differences between the Z-Transform and the Laplace Transform (s-Transform), inviting deeper reflection on their respective roles and applications.
Why did I write this book?
My motivation for writing this book comes from a long-standing curiosity: What is the essential difference between the Z-Transform (ZT) and the s-Transform (Laplace Transform)? Despite studying numerous materials and discussing the topic with course instructors, I found that the answer was not as straightforward as I had initially expected. Ultimately, I realized that the most insightful and compelling way to address this question was to retrace the original derivation process of transform pairs in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, starting from first principles.
Moreover, since this topic lies at the heart of signal and system analysis—a fundamental and widely applied area—it is worthwhile to revisit and deepen our understanding of these core modeling concepts. Most importantly, I hope that this work will offer a clearer, more intuitive path for readers to grasp these ideas by presenting a new derivation approach grounded in first-principles reasoning.
What is the advantage of this book?
While this book does not attempt to match the breadth of traditional textbooks, it offers some unique strengths. First, a consistent and unified notation system is used throughout all chapters, reducing confusion and aiding comprehension. Second, the content is intentionally concise, making it easier for readers to browse, connect key concepts, and build a holistic understanding of the modeling and derivation process. As a supplement to standard textbooks, this work provides a fresh perspective, helping readers to quickly grasp the essence of LTI system modeling and to see how various transform pairs can be constructed from the ground up.
Please note that, to ensure accessibility for readers with a junior high school education or above and to convey the beauty of this intellectual journey, this book uses the simplest possible language and detailed explanations to present the entire process of discovery. The focus is on coherence and clarity of thought, rather than rigid, formal language or standard symbols. This book emphasizes the process and methods of thinking, rather than merely presenting results and conclusions.
The aim is to encourage and promote qualities and values rooted in independent, first-principles reasoning, respect for objective natural laws, and free thought, rather than uncritical adherence to existing rules or so-called “absolute correctness.” When everyone cultivates the habit of thinking, acting, and making decisions following natural laws, society will progress toward a state of true harmony, authenticity, and integrity.
