This book aims to encourage and promote qualities and values rooted in independent, first-principles reasoning, respect for objective natural laws, and free thought, rather than uncritical adherence to existing rules or so-called “absolute correctness.” When everyone cultivates the habit of thinking, acting, and making decisions in accordance with natural laws, society will progress toward a state of genuine harmony, authenticity, and integrity.
The author hopes this book will encourage both humans and AI to discover knowledge from first principles--true AGI.
