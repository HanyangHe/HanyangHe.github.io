This book aims to encourage and promote qualities and values rooted in independent, first-principles reasoning, respect for objective natural laws, and free thought, rather than uncritical adherence to existing rules or so-called “absolute correctness.” When everyone cultivates the habit of thinking, acting, and making decisions following natural laws, society will progress toward a state of true harmony, authenticity, and integrity.
