Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical Engineering, Penn State University (PSU), 06/2023 - Currently 
* M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM), 09/2021 - 12/2022
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering, China, 09/2018 - 06/2021
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Automation, China, 09/2014 - 06/2018 
 
Research experience
======
* 06/2023-Currently: Research Assistant
  * AMPS Research project at PSU 
  * Duties included: Explore geometric constrained SINDy and kernel-based data-driven methods for system identification. Design control methods (e.g., model predictive control) associated with these identified models to deal with new challenges that emerged in the modern power system/ microgrids.
  * Supervisor: Yan Li, John Harlim, Daning Huang

* 06/2022-11/2022: Research Assistant
  * Electric Power Systems Research Group at UWM 
  * Duties included: Developing and evaluating a simplified control architecture that consists of the dual-port grid-forming control for Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) in MATLAB-Simulink.
 
* 05/2019-10/2020: Research Assistant
  * Research projects from FuJian, ChenDu, GuangZhou Electric Power Research Institute 
  * Duties included: Participated in project proposal writing and bidding processes, taking responsibility for project planning, conducting core methodological research, writing code, and preparing project reports and presentations. The project focuses on mitigating the impact of power disturbances on users in the distribution network system. Key tasks include evaluating the severity of disturbances, identifying sensitive users, and designing tailored solutions with varying economic costs to address these issues effectively. 

Work experience
======
* 11/2017-08/2018: Intern
  * Electric Power Test & Research Institute, Guangzhou Power Supply Bureau Co., Ltd
  * Duties included: Survey and interview of industrial users who suffered from power disturbance. Develop the analytical model of disturbance sensitive device in MATLAB based on hardware and lab tested results. Conduct numerical studies on these analytical model to reveal the disturbance response mechanism and give mitigation suggestions.
